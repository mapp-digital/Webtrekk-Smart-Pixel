Webtrekk provides a high-end analytical tool to analyze the traffic on your website, identify success factors
and optimize it on the basis of actual key indicators.

The basis for web analysis with Webtrekk is the pixel, which entails embedding a Webtrekk code in your
pages. This guide describes the technical implementation of the pixel. Some aspects/parameters are
mandatory while others are optional. Conceptual support about which functionalities and parameters you
should use and how the corresponding values should be set can be found in our online support center (you
can get access via your Webtrekk account). Our consultants are also available to help. Feel free to contact
us!
